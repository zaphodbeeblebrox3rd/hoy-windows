Windows (mostly PowerShell) scripts for sharing publicly.  This is under GPL licensing, which basically means you are free to use, 
modify, and share but you must publish the source code of any derivative work.

## Me
My name is Eric Hoy, and I have been using PowerShell for years in in various roles such as Systems administrator, IT Manager, Consultant, and IT Director.  As an IT Professional, my success depends on having good tools and knowing how to use them.  

I am using this repo to highlight some powerful tools and how they can be used to make life easier.  If you need to contact me for anything that doesn't fit well into the built-in "Issues" feature you can email me at gitme@hoymanor.com.  

If you want to contribute your time, feel free to fork this repo and create a pull request.  If you want to contribute funds, they will be better served by giving business to the developers in the Special Thanks section below.

### Special Thanks
I'm a simple, humble sysadmin sharing some code samples for other sysadmins.  These are mainly examples of how I interact with modules for which I cannot claim credit.

The real work which makes all of this possible is the excellent PowerShell modules published by the developers and organizations listed below.  Please give these developers your support:
- PSWindowsUpdate by [MichalGajda](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/MichalGajda) and I believe credit may also be due to [David Johnson](https://github.com/dwj7738)
- PowershellGet by [PowerShellTeam](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/PowerShellTeam)
- PackageManagement by [PowerShellTeam](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/PowerShellTeam)
- PowerCLI by [VMware](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/VMware)
